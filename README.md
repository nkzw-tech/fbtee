# fbtee

_**fbtee** (Far Better Translations, Extended Edition) is an internationalization framework for JavaScript & React designed to be **powerful**, **flexible**, and **intuitive**._

## Why `fbtee`?

- **Inline Translations for Better Developer Experience:** Embed translations directly into your code. No need to manage translation keys or wrap your code with `t()` functions. **fbtee** uses a compiler to extract strings from your code and prepare them for translation providers.
- **Proven in Production:** Built on Facebook's `fbt`, with over a decade of production usage, serving billions of users and one year of production usage in [Athena Crisis](https://athenacrisis.com).
- **Optimized Performance with IR:** Compiles translations into an Intermediate Representation (IR) for extracting strings, and optimizes the runtime output for performance.
- **Easy Setup:** Quick integration with tools like Babel and Vite means you can get started instantly.

## Status: Ready for Early Adopters

This is a fork of Facebook's original `fbt` library, which has been archived. The aim of this fork is to create the best and most modern internationalization library for JavaScript & React.

## Getting Started

**fbtee** requires at least Node 22, and React 19 if you are using React.

```bash
npm install fbtee
```

In addition to `fbtee`, you need to install the Babel preset and React plugin for Vite:

```bash
npm install -D @nkzw/babel-preset-fbtee @vitejs/plugin-react
```

In your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import fbteePreset from '@nkzw/babel-preset-fbtee';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default {
  plugins: [
    react({
      babel: {
        presets: [fbteePreset],
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

**fbtee** uses three scripts to manage translations. These scripts help automate the process of collecting, creating, and compiling translations. It is recommended to add them to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "fbtee:manifest": "fbtee manifest --src src",
    "fbtee:collect": "fbtee collect --manifest < .src_manifest.json > .source_strings.json",
    "fbtee:translate": "fbtee translate --translations translations/*.json --jenkins > src/translations.json"
  }
}
```

Here is what each command does:

- `fbtee manifest --src src` searches through files in the `src` directory and generates a manifest file (`.src_manifest.json`) that lists all the files translatable strings marked with `<fbt>`. In addition it creates `.enum_manifest.json` which lists all the files containing `<fbt:enum>` tags. Since these files are auto-generated, we recommend adding them to your `.gitignore`.
- `fbtee collect --manifest < .src_manifest.json > .source_strings.json` reads the manifest file and extracts all the strings marked for translation into a `.source_strings.json` file. This file should be uploaded to your translation provider as the source for your translations.
- `fbtee translate --translations translations/*.json --jenkins > src/translations.json` reads all the translations in the `translations/` directory and compiles them into a single `src/translations.json` file. This file is used by **fbtee** to display translated content in your app. The `--translations` parameter specifies the path to the translation files. The `--jenkins` flag is used to define the utilized [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_hash_function). You can adjust the `--translations` parameter to point to your translation directory. If your translations are within your app directory in a folder called `i18n`, for example, you'd use `--translations app/i18n/*.json`. The output is the translation file used by **fbtee**. This file is going to be referred to in your applications entry point, therefor it needs to be generated as part of the build, but should not be part of version control. This command requires the translations to be present in the `translations/` directory, created based on real translations of what was previously collected using the `collect` command.

Now, the first step is to run these commands to set up the initial strings for translation:

```bash
npm run fbtee:manifest && npm run fbtee:collect
```

The files generated by these commands should be added to `.gitignore`:

```
.src_manifest.json
.source_strings.json
.enum_manifest.json
src/translations.json
```

Next, set up **fbtee** in your app's initialization code (e.g., `src/index.tsx`):

```tsx
import { IntlVariations, setupFbtee } from 'fbtee';
import translations from './translations.json';

setupFbtee({
  hooks: {
    getViewerContext: () => ({
      GENDER: IntlVariations.GENDER_UNKNOWN,
      locale: 'en_US',
    }),
  },
  translations,
});
```

Next up, if you are using React and TypeScript in your project, you need to add TypeScript types for **fbtee** to enable proper type checking in JSX. You can do this by referencing the `ReactTypes.d.ts` file in your main `index.tsx` file or a global type declaration file (e.g., `types.d.ts`):

```tsx
/// <reference types="fbtee/ReactTypes.d.ts" />
```

_Youâ€™re now ready to define your first translatable element!_

## Usage

_If you want to learn by example, check out the [examples](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/fbtee/tree/main/example) directory._

All strings need to be wrapped by `<fbt>` (for React/JSX) or `fbt()` (for JavaScript). This ensures strings can be extracted and translated properly. The `desc` attribute is required and provides context for translators, helping them understand the intended meaning of the string.

Here are some basic examples:

```tsx
const Greeting = () => <div>Hello, World!</div>;
```

You can wrap the string with `<fbt>`:

```tsx
const Greeting = () => (
  <div>
    <fbt desc="Greeting">Hello, World!</fbt>
  </div>
);
```

`<fbt>` is a special React component that marks text for translation. The `fbtee` compiler analyzes them to extract strings, and compiles them into an Intermediate Representation (IR). It supports dynamic content through <fbt:param> or even other React components. For example, if you want to greet a specific user based on a name passed as a prop, you can use `<fbt:param>`:

```tsx
const Greeting = ({ name }) => (
  <div>
    <fbt desc="Greeting">
      Hello, <fbt:param name="name">{name}</fbt:param>!
    </fbt>
  </div>
);
```

**fbtee** allows you to use regular React Components inside of `<fbt>` which will automatically create `<fbt:param>` calls for you:

```tsx
const Greeting = ({ name }) => (
  <div>
    <fbt desc="Greeting">
      Hello, <Name name={name} />!
    </fbt>
  </div>
);
```

_Note: `<fbt>` is auto-imported for you by the `@nkzw/babel-preset-fbtee` plugin._

After marking your strings for translation with `<fbt>`, run the following commands to extract, and compile translations:

```bash
npm run fbtee:manifest && npm run fbtee:collect
```

You can now upload the `.source_strings.json` file to your translation provider. One sample for such a translation provider is [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/).

### Generated File Structure

Your `.source_strings.json` might look like this:

```json
{
  "childParentMappings": {},
  "phrases": [
    {
      "hashToLeaf": {
        "MB6OYuvCF1VzjOmqinI42g==": {
          "desc": "What's next question",
          "text": "What's next?"
        }
      },
      "col_beg": 12,
      "col_end": 68,
      "filepath": "app/welcome/welcome.tsx",
      "line_beg": 43,
      "line_end": 43,
      "project": "",
      "jsfbt": {
        "m": [],
        "t": {
          "desc": "What's next question",
          "text": "What's next?"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Based on the above source string, the US English translation (ie. `translations/en_US.json`) might look like this:

```json
{
  "fb-locale": "en_US",
  "translations": {
    "MB6OYuvCF1VzjOmqinI42g==": {
      "tokens": [],
      "types": [],
      "translations": [
        {
          "translation": "What's next?",
          "variations": []
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

And German (`translations/de_DE.json`) might look like this:

```json
{
  "fb-locale": "de_DE",
  "translations": {
    "MB6OYuvCF1VzjOmqinI42g==": {
      "tokens": [],
      "types": [],
      "translations": [
        {
          "translation": "Was kommt jetzt?",
          "variations": []
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once you have the translated strings stored in a `translations/` folder as JSON files, you can run the following command to generate the translations file:

```bash
npm run fbtee:translate
```

This will generate the `translation.json` file referred to in the setup done before. This file might look like this:

```json
{
  "de_DE": { "2HVYhv": "Was kommt jetzt?" },
  "en_US": { "2HVYhv": "What's next?" }
}
```

After generating the translations file, your app is ready to display translated content in other languages. The error you had until now in the `setupFbtee` with regards to the imported translations file should be resolved now.

Since the `translations.json` is an auto-generated file part of your build process, the `fbtee:translate` command should be added to your build step.

## ESLint Plugin

You can install the optional eslint plugin to catch common mistakes and enforce best practices when using **fbtee**:

```bash
npm install @nkzw/eslint-plugin-fbtee
```

Add the following configuration to your ESLint configuration:

```js
{
  extends: ['plugin:@nkzw/eslint-plugin-fbtee/recommended'],
  plugins: ['@nkzw/eslint-plugin-fbtee'],
}
```

If you want stricter enforcement of translation rules, you can use the strict configuration, which enables the `no-untranslated-strings` rule. This ensures that all strings in your codebase are marked for translation.

```js
{
  extends: ['plugin:@nkzw/eslint-plugin-fbtee/strict'],
  plugins: ['@nkzw/eslint-plugin-fbtee'],
}
```

Or, if you'd like more granular control over the rules:

```js
{
  plugins: ['@nkzw/eslint-plugin-fbtee'],
  rules: {
    '@nkzw/fbtee/no-empty-strings': 'error',
    '@nkzw/fbtee/no-unhelpful-desc': 'error',
    '@nkzw/fbtee/no-untranslated-strings': 'error',
  },
}
```

## What's better about `fbtee` than `fbt`?

Facebook has done an amazing job with `fbt`, an internationalization library that has been successfully used in production at Facebook for over 10 years. Their work provided a strong foundation for modern localization tools.

The open-source version of `fbt`, however, became unmaintained, difficult to set up, and incompatible with modern tools. It was eventually archived in November 2024. **fbtee** builds on this foundation with several improvements:

- **Easier Setup:** fbtee works with modern tools like Vite.
- **Statically Typed:** The fbtee compiler ensures correct usage of fbtee, libary TypeScript types are provided, and an eslint plugin helps fix common mistakes.
- **Improved React Compatibility:** Removed React-specific hacks and added support for implicit React fragments (`<>`).
- **Enhanced Features:** Fixed and exported `inltList` as a new `<fbt:list>` construt, which was not functional in the original `fbt`.
- **Modernized Codebase:** Rewritten using TypeScript, ES modules (ESM), eslint, and modern JavaScript standards. Removed cruft and legacy code.
- **Updated Tooling:** Uses modern tools like pnpm, Vite, and esbuild for faster and more efficient development of **fbtee**.

**fbtee** remains compatible with `fbt` and migration is straightforward.

## Migration from `fbt`:

**fbtee** is compatible with `fbt`. If you are already using `fbt`, migrating to fbtee is straightforward:

- Follow the "Getting Started" guide above and remove all "fbt" related packages.
- Make sure you are using React 19.
- Replace `import { fbt } from 'fbt'` with `import { fbt } from 'fbtee'`.
- Rename commands from `fbt-collect`, `fbt-manifest` and `fbt-translate` to `fbtee-collect`, `fbtee-manifest` and `fbtee-translate`.
- If you were using CommonJS modules for common strings or enums, convert them to ES modules.
- Ensure you are using the latest version of Node.js 22 or later.
- Rename your `init({})` call to `setupFbtee({})`.

After these changes, your project should work seamlessly with **fbtee**.
